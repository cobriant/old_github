# Price Controls

Governments have always tried to control prices in an effort to make systems more *fair*.

--

Sometimes they try to lower prices to help consumers; other times they try to raise prices to help producers.

---

# Price Controls: interest rates

For instance, an **interest rate** is the price of using money in the future versus using it now. In general, that price is determined by supply (people saving their money) and demand (people taking out loans).

--

Controlling interest rates is also one of the oldest examples of price controls.

--

Old Testament: &lt;span class='lightblue'&gt;making a profit off a loan from a poor person is exploiting that person.&lt;/span&gt;

---

# OPEC in the 1970s

We talked before about how OPEC colluded to restrict their supply of crude oil in order to raise oil prices and increase their revenue. That worked for about 10 years, until countries outside of OPEC were able to respond by pumping their own oil.

--

But in 1973, the U.S. government responded to the rapidly increasing price of oil by setting a **price ceiling** on the price that U.S. oil companies could charge for gasoline. What happened?

--

**price ceiling - a maximum legal price someone can charge for a good**

# 1970s "Oil Crisis"

This event was deemed an "oil crisis" because of the shortage and how hard it was to get gasoline.

--

But that shortage was completely due to the price ceiling. If prices had been allowed to adjust, there would have been no shortage and no crisis, just unusually high prices for awhile.

# More examples of price ceilings

Price gouging in a disaster is illegal in most states, including in Oregon.

--

Last year: face masks, hand sanitizer, toilet paper.

--

Are stores taking advantage of people in emergency situations by raising the price? Economists argue that high prices provide a useful **incentive** for stores to stay open during a disaster, to sell as many units of the good as possible, and also so consumers only buy what they *need* and not stockpile just in case they need them.

---

# Rent Control is another price ceiling

Cities have become really popular places to live, and the thing about cities is that there's limited land. You'd like to live close to everything, but so does everyone else!

--

So there's high demand for city apartments with great locations, and a fairy inelastic supply, especially in the short run. That means high prices.

---

# Rent Control is another price ceiling

The goal of rent control policies is to help the poor by making housing more affordable for them.

--

That should be your first red flag as an economics student. Why not just help the poor by giving them some wealth transfers? When the government messes with prices, they're messing with *incentives*, and usually that means unintended consequences...

---

# Rent Control

The first instance of rent control in the U.S. was during World War 2. People felt it was wrong that landlords could raise rents on young people while they were off fighting for the U.S. somewhere. 

--

Many cities instituted rent control policies during this time and repealed it soon after, but some kept it (New York).

---

# Rent Control

Goals of rent control:

--

- stop gentrification

--

- give people a sense of security that they won't be priced out of their neighborhoods

--

In the short run, rent control does a pretty good job at accomplishing these.

---

---

# Rent control

In the long run, supply becomes more elastic and quantity supplied falls.

--

As soon as landlords can, they'll try to sell this asset that's had a permanent fall in value. They'll try to evict current tenants and build something commercial.

--

That's why cities have rules about not being able to evict your tenants after rent control.

---

# Rent control

So landlords will no longer maintain the apartments and they'll let them decay over time.

--

&lt;span class='lightblue'&gt;Rent control is "the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city—except for bombing."&lt;/span&gt; - Swedish economist  Assar Lindbeck

--

To combat this, cities make new construction exempt from rent control.

---

# Rent control

So landlords respond to rent control in two ways:

--

&lt;span class='small'&gt;1. They tear down their apartment buildings and build new condos at very high prices (but rent control was supposed to stop gentrification!)&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small'&gt;2. They *ration* their apartments at the lower price. This might look like long waiting lists, letting the apartment decay, giving preference to tenants who are willing to give them under-the-table payments, giving preference to tenants of a certain race, etc. These rationing mechanisms can be very undesirable, and rules to try to control them are hard to enforce.&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Rent control

Rent control helps *some* of the original renters. But in the long run, it certainly doesn't help all renters, and creates perverse incentives for landlords to participate in bad behavior.

--

In the long run, rent control decreases affordability and fuels gentrification. This is what the microeconomic theory predicts, and the data supports it.

---

# Rent control

Now, almost all expensive cities in the US have some type of rent control. In 2019, Oregon became the first state to pass a state-wide rent-control bill.

--

The great majority of economists however say rent control is a bad idea.

--

So far we've covered 3 examples of really destructive price ceilings. What about price **floors**? Are they just as destructive?

# The Minimum Wage is a Price Floor

Minimum wage: a legal minimum for the price of labor.

--

As a result, some sellers (workers) are unable to sell all the labor hours they'd like to. There's *unemployment*.

--

Jobs are **rationed** based on the personal biases of employers. Employers might give preference to family members or members of their own race.

---

# Minimum Wage

Minimum wage will only have an impact on labor markets where it's **binding**. For most jobs, the wage is already much higher than any minimum wage law would dictate.

--

The minimum wage has the most impact on the market for teenage labor. Teenagers are the least skilled and least experienced, and they're also often willing to accept a lower wage in exchange for on-the-job training.

---

# Minimum Wage

What does the data say? A 10% increase in the minimum wage leads to a decrease in teenage employment by a fairly large 1-3%. Obviously, a 10% increase in the minimum wage does not increase the average income of an employed teenager by 10%, because for many teenagers, the minimum wage isn't binding.

--

Economists are about evenly divided on the issue between thinking minimum wage should be decreased, increased, or stay the same.

---

# Minimum Wage

Does increasing the minimum wage raise the income of the working poor? 

--

Not well. A much higher minimum wage would more likely cause unemployment than help the working poor. In fact, less than 1/3 of minimum-wage workers are in families with incomes below the poverty line. Most are teenagers from middle-class homes working part-time jobs for extra spending money. Just like rent control, the most efficient way to help the poor is to do it directly, rather than through their jobs.
