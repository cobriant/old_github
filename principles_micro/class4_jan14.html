# Last class

We learned about **marginal thinking** as a tool for optimization.

--

If we continue to buy sushi rolls as long as the marginal benefit is greater than or equal to the marginal cost, we can identify our optimal number of sushi rolls.

--

We also learned the law of demand and the principle of diminishing marginal utility.

--

A couple questions from the exit survey...

---

# Optimization with Marginal Thinking

**Q: Tie-breaking rule. Why do we still buy the good even if the marginal benefit is equal to the marginal cost?**

--

&lt;span class='darkblue small squeeze'&gt;Great question. If marginal benefit is greater than marginal cost, you're gaining surplus, so obviously you should keep buying. If marginal cost is greater than marginal benefit, you should not buy the unit because you're losing surplus. But if they're equal, you're neither gaining nor losing surplus.&lt;/span&gt;

--

| Unit | Total Benefit | Marginal Benefit | Marginal Cost | Total Cost | Surplus |
|:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 11 | 11 | 8 | 8 | 3 |
| 2 | 20 | 9 | 8 | 16 | 4 |
| 3 | 28 | 8 | 8 | 24 | 4 |
| 4 | 35 | 7 | 8 | 32 | 3 |

# Optimization with Marginal Thinking

&lt;span class='darkblue squeeze small'&gt;These discrete problems (you can buy 1 sushi roll, 2 sushi rolls, etc) are rough approximations for the continuous problems (2.53623 rolls is an option) you'll do if you continue with economics.&lt;/span&gt;

--

.pull-left[
&lt;span class='darkblue squeeze small'&gt;The optimum for those problems happens at the point where **Marginal Benefit = Marginal Cost**, because Marginal Benefit - Marginal Cost is the slope of the tangent line of total surplus. Our tie-breaking rule will always get you that solution.&lt;/span&gt;]

# Marginal Thinking

**Q: Is the marginal benefit always a number or can it be words too?**

--

&lt;span class='darkblue small squeeze'&gt;Marginal benefits (and costs) are oftentimes much more complicated and nuanced than just amounts of money. But it's the economist's job to try to measure those things. How do you compare the benefits of a few thousand teens not becoming smokers with the costs to those already addicted? Using money is as good as any other way.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class='lightblue small squeeze'&gt;"Economics is above all a science of measurement. It comprises an extraordinarily powerful and flexible set of tools that can reliably assess a thicket of information to determine the effect of any one factor, or even the whole effect." (*Freakonomics*)&lt;/span&gt;

---

&lt;!--
Other questions (elasticity):

* Why aren't certain companies seemingly as concerned with supply not meeting demand? I.e. new xbox and playstation still not available for retail price.
  + companies can keep price high that way. when there are lots of available substitutes and there's more competition, companies don't have this behavior
--&gt;

We can think of demand (and marginal benefit) as a way to understand how many rolls of sushi **one person** will buy given the price.

--
We can also think of demand as a way to understand how many rolls of sushi will be purchased by **all the people in Eugene** today, depending on the price.

When the price of sushi is high, the only people who will buy any are those with the highest marginal benefit for sushi. If $20 is the price, you won't buy sushi unless your marginal benefit is greater than or equal to $20. Think of the market clearing price exercises from class 1.

When the price of sushi is low, everyone will buy it except for those with the lowest marginal benefits for sushi. Also, if my marginal benefits for rolls of sushi is $10 for the first one, $8 for the second, and $7 for the third, I would "be in line" in all of those spots.

# Demand for cigarettes

This is a (positive) statement about the shape of the **demand curve** for cigarettes.

# Demand for cigarettes

Oregon increased the cigarette tax at the beginning of this year from $1.33 to $3.33.

--

Suppose that means that the average price of a pack of cigarettes has gone from $6 to $8.

--

How much has the price of cigarettes increased, in percentage terms?

---

# Percentage Change Formula

(new - old) / old

--

(8 - 6) / 6 =

--
2/6 = 

--
1/3 =

--
.3333

--

In percentage terms, you would say that the price of cigarettes increased by 33.3%.

---

# Demand for Cigarettes

The statement we'd like to evaluate: &lt;span class='pink'&gt;A 10% increase in the price of cigarettes will lead to a 3-5% decrease in consumption.&lt;/span&gt;

--

Since the price of cigarettes increased by 33%, will the consumption of cigarettes decrease by 9-15%?

--

Last year's consumption of cigarettes in Oregon: 

--
about 390,000 packs per day.

--

If the statement holds, we should see that cigarette consumption falls by 9-15% of 390,000, or about 35k to 60k fewer cigarette packs will be sold *every day*.

If the $2 price increase creates this much of a change in consumption, the statement in the infographic will be verified. The statement makes a conjecture about what the slope of the demand curve might be.

# Price Elasticity of Demand

**Price elasticity of demand**- a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good, computed as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.

--

&lt;span class='small pink'&gt;% change in Q_d / % change in Price&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small'&gt;If consumption (Q_d) for cigarettes drops by 5% when price increases by 10%, then the **price elasticity of demand** = &lt;/span&gt;

--
&lt;span class='small'&gt;5/10 =&lt;/span&gt;

--
&lt;span class='small'&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class='small'&gt;We would say that the price elasticity of demand for cigarettes is &lt;span class='pink'&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

# Price Elasticity of Demand

**So price elasticity of demand isn't exactly the same as the slope, although they both describe the effect of price on quantity demanded.** 

--

The reason for that is just the difference between a change in magnitudes and a change in percentages. The price elasticity of demand going from (1,3) to (0,4) in that example is 3, because increasing price by 33% (3 to 4) led to a 100% decrease in consumption.

# Price Elasticity of Demand

This is what a demand curve with a constant price elasticity of 1 looks like.

# Price Elasticity of Demand

**Q: What happens when there are no available substitutes for an increasingly expensive good/service?**

--

.pull-left[When there are no available substitutes, then consumers are stuck paying the higher price. As price increases, consumers aren't able to change their consumption very much. Here, the price elasticity of demand is 10/40 = 0.25.]

# Inelastic demand

.pull-left[**Inelastic demand - the price elasticity of demand is less than 1.** A **perfectly inelastic demand** has a price elasticity of demand of 0 and is a vertical line. Any change in price leads to no change in quantity demanded.]

--

The good could have no available substitutes, it's a necessity, or we've very broadly defined the market (demand for food versus a specific kind of food like ice cream).

---

# Elastic Demand

**Q: Can the demand curve ever be flat?**

--

Yes! If substitutes are widely available, the good is a luxury good that's not necessary for anyone, or we've defined the market very specifically (butter pecan ice cream, not just ice cream).

--
.pull-left[A flatter demand curve means that as soon as price increases just a little bit, consumers immediately react by buying a lot less.]

# Other Demand Determinants

Suppose my income doubles. I may suddenly find that because I'm better able to afford it, I'm willing to pay more for each sushi roll, or in other words, I'll eat more sushi *at any given price*.

--

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="figures/shift_out.jpg" width="2305" height="70%" /&gt;
]

--

.pull-right[When a variable that's **not named on either axis** changes, the demand curve may shift in or out.]

---

# Income

**Income elasticity of demand** - a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in consumers' income.

--

income elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded / % change in income

--

Most goods are **normal goods**- higher income raises the quantity demanded. Normal goods have positive income elasticities. But some goods are **inferior goods**- higher income lowers the quantity demanded. Inferior goods have negative income elasticities. Examples of inferior goods include bus rides and fast food.

---

# Price of other goods

If the price of BBQ increases, I'll also probably be willing to buy more sushi at any given price. That's because when I eat out, I usually either get BBQ or I get sushi.

--

.pull-left[For me, BBQ and sushi are **substitutes** - two goods for which an increase in the price of one leads to an increase in the demand for the other.]

# Cross-price elasticity of demand

**Cross-price elasticity of demand** - a measure of how much the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good.

--

Cross-price elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded of good 1 / % change in the price of good 2

--

So substitutes like BBQ and sushi have a **positive** cross-price elasticity of demand.

---

# Cross-price elasticity of demand

**Cross-price elasticity of demand** - a measure of how much the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good.

Cross-price elasticity of demand = % change in quantity demanded of good 1 / % change in the price of good 2

But if two goods are **complements** (two goods for which an increase in the price of one leads to a decrease in the demand for the other), their cross-price elasticity of demand will be negative. Think about peanut butter and jelly.

# Demand Determinants

Factors that may cause a "shift out" of demand for sushi in Eugene:

* Overall, people's incomes increase
* Price of soy sauce decreases
* Price of tacos increase
* Quality of sushi increases
* Advertising for sushi increases
* Age of customers: more young adults move to Eugene

# Review

.pull-left[When the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded will decrease by moving along the demand curve (law of demand). The amount that it decreases depends on the *price elasticity of demand*.]

# Review

* When income increases, the quantity demanded for normal goods increases by shifting the demand curve out. If the good is inferior, the quantity demanded will decrease for every given price. The amount that the quantity demanded changes depends on the *income elasticity of demand*.

--

* When the price of another good increases, the quantity demanded of a certain good may increase or decrease for every given price depending on whether it's a complement or a substitute. The amount that the quantity demanded changes depends on the *cross-price elasticity of demand* and the demand curve will shift in or out.
