# Last week

We put supply and demand together, learned about equilibrium, and studied how when the supply and demand curves shift, excess supply or excess demand is resolved as the price of the good adjusts.

---

# Next class

Answering questions for the midterm!

---

# This class

Why do some jobs pay well and some jobs don't? What are the factors that determine a wage?

--

This is about 80% reviewing of all the concepts we've learned, with about 20% new information. Hopefully you'll find it's a helpful application.

# Freakonomics

Wage question according to Freakonomics:

&lt;span class='lightblue'&gt;"Immutable law of labor: when there are a lot of people willing and able to do a job, that job generally doesn't pay well... The specialized skills a job requires, the unpleasantness of a job, and the demand for services that the job fulfills."&lt;/span&gt;

--

The number of people willing and able to do a job: the *labor supply*.

The specialized skills a job requires and the unpleasantness of it are other factors that influence the *labor supply*.

# Wage

Wages are determined by labor supply and demand. Wages are the price in the market for a certain type of labor!

--

So if the demand for Economists (by companies like Amazon) shifts out in the next year, I'll probably expect to get a higher paying job, wherever I decide to go.

--

But if the supply of Economists (by people) doubles in the next year, I'll probably expect to get a lower paying job.

---

# Goods Markets vs Labor Markets

Labor is a **factor of production**: firms use it as an input in order to produce their output.

--

So the big difference between the markets for Goods and the markets for Labor is who represents supply and who represents demand.

---

# Q: Since firms are profit maximizing, why don't they pay all workers a wage of $0?

When you go to the grocery store, you can't buy apples for $0 just because you'd prefer it if they were free. You have to pay the market price for an apple.

--

The same way, firms can't buy labor for $0 just because they'd prefer to. Firms pay the market price for that labor. 

--

The market price depends on supply and demand. The market price is also the *value of the marginal productivity* of that worker. I'll show you what that means..

---

# Labor Demand

Every firm has a &lt;span class='yellowunderline'&gt;production function&lt;/span&gt; - a plan about how to turn inputs (labor, capital, and land) into outputs (whatever it is they produce).

--

Universities use professors' time (labor), buildings and textbooks (capital), and the physical space where campuses are built (land) to produce educational services.

---

# Labor Demand

Firms choose how much output to supply based on the market price and their marginal costs of production: this is the *supply curve*. 

--

Based on how much output they want to supply, the firm can figure out how many inputs (labor, capital, land) they will need. 

--

So labor demand is *derived* from the firm's supply and the market price of the output.

---

# Labor Demand

For example, how many professors will a university hire?

--

That depends on how many educational services they want to produce and how productive professors are at producing them.

--

&lt;span class='large pink'&gt;The supply of a good (like education) and demand for its inputs (like professors) are two sides of the same coin.&lt;/span&gt;

# What can cause the labor demand curve to shift?

We learned that labor demand is the *value of the marginal product of labor*, or the Price x MPL.

--

Then a shift in labor demand is whenever Price x MPL changes given any wage rate.

--

One way that can happen is if the price of the output good changes. For isntance, when the price of apples increases, apple firms will hire more apple pickers because they want to produce more apples.

---

# What can cause the labor demand curve to shift?

Another way Price x MPL can change is if the productivity of workers changes. If a technological advancement helps each worker be more productive, firms will want to hire more workers and spend less on other things. This is called "labor-augmenting" technology.

--

There's also "labor-saving" technology, where firms no longer need so many workers for production, and firms will hire fewer workers as a result.

# What About Labor Supply?

If you work for a company, you're **supplying** your labor to that firm.

--

What goes into your decision about what job you want to have?

--

* Your tastes: your likes and dislikes
* The wage you would earn
* How hard is it to learn the skills necessary? I'll need to be compensated for that.
* How unpleasant, stressful, or dangerous is the job? I'll need to be compensated for that.
* The location of the job, how much esteem comes with it, etc.

---

# What would cause a labor supply curve to shift?

&lt;span class='darkblue'&gt;Changes in tastes or attitudes toward work:&lt;/span&gt;

--
In 1950, only 34% of women were employed or looking for work. Now, that number has risen to 60%.

--

&lt;span class='darkblue'&gt;Migration or immigration: &lt;/span&gt;

--
When workers move from region to region or country to country in large numbers, that can increase the supply of labor for certain jobs.

--

&lt;span class='darkblue'&gt;Changes in alternative opportunities:&lt;/span&gt;

--
Since skills can have lots of crossover between industries, a change in one labor market can impact the labor supply in similar labor markets.

# Immigration in the U.S.

Labor theory says that high immigration should drive wages down, especially for low-skilled jobs. Is this why we've seen wages for low-skilled workers in the U.S. steadily decline?

--

No.

--
Labor economists find that wages are about 1-3% lower today as a result of immigration: it's just not a very big effect. The reason for that is probably because labor demand shifts out as labor supply shifts out because of technology and growth in the economy. On net, immigration is very beneficial for the U.S. economy.

---

# Labor in the U.S.

So why do immigrants get such a bad rap? 

--

Why does it seem like jobs for Americans are getting worse even as the country is getting richer?

---

# Labor in the U.S.

Let's look back at the Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy...

--

* 7% of the public thinks that **there are too many immigrants** is a major issue, compared to 0% of economists (1.5% of you all). 

--

* 8% of the public thinks that **people place too little value on hard work** is a major issue, compared to 4% of economists (7% of you all).

---

# Labor in the U.S.

* 31% of the public thinks that **companies are sending jobs overseas** is a major issue, compared to 2% of economists (30% of you all).

--

* 12% of the public thinks that **companies are downsizing** is a major issue, compared to 2% of economists (5% of you all).

--

* 14% of the public think that **too many people are on welfare** is a major issue, compared to 1% of economists (13% of you).

---

# Labor in the U.S.

* 6% of the public think that **technology is displacing workers** is a major issue, compared to 1% of economists (14% of you).

--

People are really worried about losing American jobs. Economists... aren't really. What's going on?

---

# Make-work Bias

**Make-work bias:** a tendency to underestimate the economic benefits of conserving labor.

&lt;span class='footnote'&gt;*"Myth of the Rational Voter"*, Bryan Caplan&lt;/span&gt;

--

The public is concerned about foreigners or computers taking their jobs because they think that a person must have a job in order to prosper. 

--
That sentiment is deeply rooted in our human psychology. 

--
But economists see things very differently: when a job is destroyed, that means the economy can now produce more with less. That's the essence of economic growth!

---

&lt;span class='lightblue'&gt;"What we should wish for, clearly, is that each hectare of land produce little wheat, and that each kernel of wheat contain little sustenance-- in other words, that our land should be unfruitful... One could even say that job opportunities would be in direct proportion to this unfruitfulness... What we should desire still more is that human intelligence should be enfeebled or extinguished; for, so long as it survives, it ceaselessly endeavors to increase the *ratio of the end to the means and of the product to the effort*."&lt;/span&gt; - Frederic Bastiat, Economic Sophisms

---

Worker displacements are economic growing pains. How can we help those who are displaced? Welfare, unemployment insurance, retraining, and relocation subsidies.

--

&lt;span class='lightblue'&gt; "In 1800, it took nearly 95 of every 100 Americans to feed the country. In 1900, it took 40. Today, it takes just 3... The workers no longer needed on farms have been put to use providing new homes, furniture, clothing, computers, pharmaceuticals, appliances, medical assistance, movies, financial advice, video games, gourmet meals, and an almost dizzying array of other goods and services... What we have in place of long hours in the fields is the wealth of goods and services that come from allowing the churn to work, wherever and whenever it might occur."&lt;/span&gt; - *"Myths of Rich and Poor"*, Cox and Alm, 1999.

---

Whenever we figure out how to do something with less, society gets richer because we can do something valuable with the saved resource. For example, when you get a washing machine, you don't worry about what you'll do with all those hours you're going to save.

&lt;span class='footnote'&gt;*"Myth of the Rational Voter"*, Bryan Caplan&lt;/span&gt;

--

This is why economists aren't concerned about the long term consequences of factors like **technology displacing workers** and **companies downsizing**.

# Microeconomic Theory as Career Advice?

Glamour jobs are highly sought after and the competition for them is fierce. To get one, you have to be very lucky, incredibly talented, and also incredibly hard working.

--

The good news is that if you have the drive to even start competing for one of those jobs, then if you decide to pivot to something else, you'll easily find success in jobs with a higher demand.

---

# Microeconomic Theory as Career Advice?

If you follow your interests and get really specialized at something a large number of people might pay you a lot of money to do, you can make a career out of that.

--

If you enjoy this class, you're probably very analytical and curious. You may find a job in data science fun and interesting. A great next step for honing those skills: EC 320 and 421: Econometrics sequence.

--
Especially if I teach those next year!

# Review

Wage is the price of labor. The wage rate for any job adjusts to balance the supply and demand for labor.

--

Wage also equals the value of the marginal product of labor. So a worker is compensated based on the price of the good they help make and their productivity in making it.

--

A job disappearing is actually a sign of economic growth. It means we no longer need to spend as many resources to get something done. In the short term, a person is out of work. But in the long run, that resource can be redirected toward a more valuable use.
