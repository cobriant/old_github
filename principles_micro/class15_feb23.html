# [So how free is trade around the world?](https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization)

* International trade accounts for a huge amount of the world's GDP, but the U.S. lags behind

* Trade liberalization in a country seems to cause faster economic growth in that country, as microeconomic theory would predict

* Trade liberalization also reduces the cost of living, so while it does not help employment in sectors that the country does not have a comparative advantage in, it likely makes poorer people in general much better off.

"It's a race!" | Companies have competitors, but countries don't have competitors.
Trade is zero sum | Trade has mutual benefits

&lt;!-- The public misidentifies money with wealth. They think that if we give money to another country for some of their goods, they must be richer as a result and we must be poorer. But trade isn't "zero-sum": two parties decide to trade because both of them get something they want out of it! So when two parties trade, it's because they both get richer from it. --&gt;

# Antiforeign Bias

Public | Economists
--- | ---
"It's a race!" | Companies have competitors, but countries don't have competitors.
Trade is zero sum | Trade has mutual benefits
Money and goods can be exchanged between regions, but not between countries! | Trade is the same, whether it's with your neighbor or someone on the other side of the world.

&lt;!-- People aren't worried about money draining out of the state or the region. But for some reason, people are very worried about money leaving the country. It's a logical fallacy where people understand that domestic purchases involve costs and benefits, but they only think of foreign purchases in terms of the costs and they forget the benefits. Gains from trade is one of the most fascinating concepts in economics. There's no important difference between domestic and foreign trade. If another party can make something cheaper than you can make it, mutually beneficial trade is possible even if one party is less productive in every way! --&gt;

# Antiforeign Bias

&gt; "There are two technologies for producing automobiles in America. One is to manufacture them in Detroit, and the other is to grow them in Iowa. Everybody knows about the first technology, let me tell you about the second. First you plant seeds, which are the raw materials from which automobiles are constructed. You wait a few months until wheat appears. Then you harvest the wheat, load it onto ships, and sail the ships westward into the Pacific Ocean. After a few months, the ships reappear with Toyotas on them." 

&gt; -Steven Landsburg, *The Armchair Economist*, 1993

# Immigration: trade in the market for labor

Immigration is the most tightly restricted type of trade in the world. If you were born poor in a poor country, it's basically impossible for you to move to a rich country. 

--

Who makes it impossible? The people who were born in rich countries. The laws they've passed keep you out.

---

# Immigration: trade in the market for labor

Human smugglers charge immigrants $4,000 per person to smuggle them across America's southern border, which is several years' income for a rural Mexian farmer.

--

About half of these undocumented immigrants are then caught by ICE. But many immigrants still take the chance because the potential gains for them are high.

---

# Gains from trade: immigration

Imagine there was a small town of farmers on the North Pole, trying to farm through all snow. They're starving because that's incredibly un-fertile land.

--

If another country with more fertile land let them immigrate, the North Pole-ians will suddenly become much more productive farmers, turning a profit instead of starving.

--

But the people in the fertile country also benefit, because they too can enjoy the extra food the North Pole-ians are growing.

---

# Gains from trade: immigration

The reason poor countries are poor is that, for whatever reason, the people in that country can't be **productive**. They probably aren't trying to farm through snow, but it could be because...

--

&lt;span class='squeeze'&gt;
* Workers don't have access to technology or machines
* Workers don't have access to resources that will help them build skills
* Entrepreneurs can't take out loans
* Government institutions are corrupt
* And many others!
&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Gains from trade: immigration

Rich countries are rich because in countries like the U.S., it's easy for people to be productive. The more **stuff** we make given a certain amount of inputs, the more **stuff** we can consume.

--

But productivity is a reflection of the country, more than the worker. A poor immigrant who leaves Haiti can expect to earn about *10 times* as much in America because he'll be so much more productive.

---

# Gains from trade: immigration

And when that Haitian immigrant becomes a ton more productive, Americans benefit too from all the things they are making.

--

So how big are the potential gains from trade of, say, completely open borders? Where anyone on Earth could take a job anywhere else? Economists estimate it's 50-150% of gross world product.

&lt;span class='footnote'&gt;Michael Clemens, "Economics and Emigration," 2011&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Gains from trade: immigration

The world now produces about $75 trillion a year. A 50-150% boost would mean anywhere between $112 T to $187 T. That's an extra 4-14 McDonald's happy meals a day *per person*.

--

So yes, open borders might mean that some Americans would have to re-skill. But with those kinds of gains, a good option might be for them to retire early! The best estimate is that world GDP would *double*. Much more immigration seems like a no-brainer.
