# Questions from last class

Great questions that we'll cover later:

--

* What happens when firms have power over the market and can set prices? (Monopolies, after the midterm)

--

* When an industry negatively impacts the environment, how do we understand that in the supply and demand model? (Externalities, after the midterm)

--

* When firms profit maximize, how do wages not fall to practically zero? (Factor Markets, next week)

# Questions from last class

Q: Do prices adjust more efficiently in a Capitalist economic system than in a Socialist system?

--

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;That's not likely. But we have to be specific about what we mean by "Capitalist" and "Socialist". Is the U.S. system the "Capitalist" system? And are Northern European systems with higher taxes, more wealth redistribution, and a more generous social safety net the "Socialist" system?&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Questions from last class

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;If so, then no, prices will adjust just as efficiently. Wealth redistribution may lower the incentive to work by a little bit, but a lot of social programs end up paying for themselves. High taxes may encourage people who make a lot of money to move to Florida or Texas. But taking money from the rich and giving to the poor has no other consequences on prices. These are the types of questions that welfare economists study.&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;However, if the type of Socialism you're talking about is authoritarian and has a planned economy with price setting, then prices cannot adjust to reflect supply and demand information. Every market will have excess surplus or excess demand. People will never be able to find the products they want, and stores will be filled to the brim with goods people don't want.&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Last class

The market equilibrium is where the supply and demand curves intersect.

--

The equilibrium price clears the market so that the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded.

---

# Last class

Excess demand is resolved when the price of the good is bid up. When the price increases, suppliers may be incentivized to increase production. And more price sensitive consumers may reduce their quantity demanded.

--

Excess supply is resolved when producers realize they aren't making enough sales and they reduce the price. When the price goes down, the quantity consumers will demand will increase by a little and the quantity suppliers will produce will decrease a little, until they meet in the middle.

---

# This class

We'll see more examples of how supply and demand shifting effects the equilibrium quantity and price. We'll also see how elasticity effects those supply and demand interactions.

--

The method:

1. Will this impact supply or demand?
2. Is it a shift *in* or a shift *out*?
3. DRAW IT! How does the equilibrium price and quantity exchanged change?

---

# Housing market example from last class

Suppose a big company opens a factory in a small town and brings hundreds of new jobs. People interested in working there start to try to move into the town. How will this effect the market for housing in the town?

--

1) Will this impact supply or demand?

--
&lt;span class='orange'&gt;This will impact demand. The number of people who are interested in *buying* houses has changed dramatically.&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Housing market example from last class

2) Will this shift the demand curve...

**in** (at any price, less will be bought; for every unit, people have a lower MB)

or **out** (at any price, more will be bought; for every unit, people have a higher MB)?

--
&lt;span class='orange'&gt;It shifts demand **out**. At any price of houses, more houses will be bought than before.&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Housing market example from last class

3) DRAW IT! How does p* and q* change?

&lt;span class='lightblue'&gt;*if you don't draw it, you're risking it!*&lt;/span&gt;

# Winter Coats in March Example From Last Class

The weather is starting to warm up in March. What happens to the market for winter coats?

1) Will this impact supply or demand?

--
&lt;span class='orange'&gt;This will impact demand. The number of people who are interested in *buying* winter coats has changed.&lt;/span&gt;

---

# What we've done so far:


&lt;span class='green'&gt;[x] Demand shifts out&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='green'&gt;[x] Demand shifts in&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='orange'&gt;[ ] Supply shifts out&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='orange'&gt;[ ] Supply shifts in&lt;/span&gt;

# There's a major freeze in Brazil and Columbia. What happens to the market for coffee?

* Supply effect, since Brazil and Columbia produce coffee

--

* Shifts supply *in* because at any given price, there's less coffee being produced

--

* Draw it, what happens to the equilibrium price and quantity exchanged?

# Can good news for farming be bad news for farmers?

&lt;span class='footnote'&gt;Principles of Microeconomics, Gregory Mankiw&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;Suppose you're a wheat farmer in Kansas. All year long you try to make your land as productive as possible, monitoring your soil, checking your fields for pests and disease, and studying the latest advancements in farm technology.&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;Then one day, Kansas State University announces a major discovery. Researchers have developed a new hybrid of wheat that raises the amount farmers can produce by 20%! And it's available for you to use! This is good news for your profits, right?&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Can good news for farming be bad news for farmers?

1) Does this impact supply or demand?

--
&lt;span class='orange'&gt;Supply.&lt;/span&gt;

--

2) Does this shift the supply curve in or out?

--
&lt;span class='orange'&gt;Out, at any given price, everyone can make 20% more wheat.&lt;/span&gt;

--

3) Draw it!

# Can good news for farming be bad news for farmers?

&lt;span class='footnote'&gt;Principles of Microeconomics, Gregory Mankiw&lt;/span&gt;

So if farmers become *worse* off by the discovery of this new hybrid, why do they adopt it?

--
For any given price of wheat, it's better for the farmer to go ahead and use the hybrid and produce more wheat at a lower cost. But when *all* farmers do this, the supply of wheat increases and the price of it falls.

--
The good news for farming is actually bad news for farmers, but fantastic news for consumers! Now, the price of wheat has dropped substantially.

# Why did OPEC fail to keep the price of oil high?

&lt;span class='footnote'&gt;Principles of Microeconomics, Gregory Mankiw&lt;/span&gt;

In the 1970s, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) tried to raise the world price of oil to increase their revenue and profits.

--

They accomplished this by jointly reducing the amount of oil they supplied (supply shifts in).

--

From 1973 to 1974, the price of oil rose more than 50%. Then they did it again: from 1979 to 1981, the price of oil doubled!

---

# Why did OPEC fail to keep the price of oil high?

&lt;span class='footnote'&gt;Principles of Microeconomics, Gregory Mankiw&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;But OPEC found it difficult to maintain a high price: from 1982 to 1985, the price of oil steadily declined about 10% per year. By 1986, cooperation between OPEC countries completely broke down and the price of oil plunged 45%.&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;In the short run, supply for oil is inelastic, so the collusion was effective. But in the long run, producers of oil outside of OPEC responded to the high prices by increasing oil exploration and by building new extraction capacity. Also, in the long run demand for oil was more elastic. People started buying smaller cars and needing less gas.&lt;/span&gt;

---

# What happens to the market for ice cream in the U.S. when there's a hurricane followed by a heat wave?

The heat wave makes people want to buy more ice cream. This shifts **demand for ice cream out**.

--

But the hurricane destroys sugar cane farms in Florida, shifting the supply for sugar cane in and raising the price of sugar cane, which is an input to ice cream. This shifts the **supply of ice cream in**.

--

We'd definitely better draw this one!
