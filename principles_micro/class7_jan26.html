# Last class

**Sunk costs** are costs that have already been incurred and can't be recovered. When an airline can't fill the last few seats on a flight, they'll drop the price. They've already scheduled the flight and sold some seats, so the cost of the flight is sunk. 

Because of that, any money the airline can make on those last seats is profitable.

---

# Questions

Q: Could it be considered unethical for companies, like airlines and hotels, to make the best from sunk cost situations? If two passengers are sitting next to each other on a plane, one might have gotten their ticket right before the flight for 50% cheaper than the person sitting next to him paid. **Isn't that unfair?**

---

# Questions

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;Perhaps! (of course, this is normative territory now)&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;Charging two people different prices for the same good is called &lt;span class='yellowunderline'&gt;price discrimination&lt;/span&gt;, and we'll talk more about this topic later in the class.&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;Companies *can never* discriminate on the basis of categories like race, gender, age, religion, or sexual orientation. But many forms of price discrimination are legal.&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Questions

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;Who wins and who loses with airline price discrimination?&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;The airline wins because they're able to replace big losses with small ones. Who else?&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;The savvy customer wins because they got a great deal on the flight. The not-so-savvy customer loses because they had to pay full price. But...&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Questions

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;If the savvy customer got the deal because they spent 5 minutes every day for 3 months monitoring the price of that flight, the great deal starts to look not so much like a great deal.&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;It's also a risky game: the flight could sell out at any time, and then the savvy customer would just be out of luck.&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Questions

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;Consider the alternative: if the government made price discrimination illegal, what would happen?&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;The price of flights would probably decrease a little bit for everybody, airlines would make less money, but the most price sensitive consumers might never be able to afford to fly again! This is probably a bad situation from an equity standpoint.&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Last class

We also finished the topic of **supply**. This week, we'll put supply and demand together into a complete analysis of competitive markets! Before we begin, one last question about supply:

--

**Q: Can we think of the supply curve as profit for the producers?**

--

&lt;span class='small darkblue'&gt;No, supply is not producer profit. But the two concepts are very related! The supply curve represents **all the points where producer profit is maximized** given a market price. That is, given the market price, supply is *the amount a producer will want to produce*.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;!-- classwork 7.1: identifying excess supply, excess demand, existence of gains from trade --&gt;

# Excess Demand in an Auction

--

When the price is low, you have lots of bidders.

&lt;img src="figures/excess_demand_auction.jpg" width="400" /&gt;

--

The auctioneer raises the price until there's just one bidder left, where the quantity supplied (1) is equal to the quantity demanded (1).

# Excess Demand in a Housing Market

Suppose a big company opens a factory in a small town and brings hundreds of new jobs. People interested in working there start moving to the town, and competing for the limited housing.

--

Say in recent years, it's normal for 75 homes to be sold each year in this town. But quantity demanded now far exceeds quantity supplied: there's excess demand!

--

The first properties are sold very quickly, but soon sellers hold out longer because they know they can get higher bids. Houses begin to sell for higher and higher prices.

---

# Excess Demand in a Housing Market

Then two things might happen: 

--

1. Quantity demanded might **shrink** a little as newcomers decide the price is getting too high and they decide to live in nearby towns and commute. 

--

2. Quantity supplied might **rise** a little as townsfolk who weren't planning on selling their house yet observe that the market is booming, and they figure they can retire early to Florida on the extra money from selling their house.

---

# Excess Demand in a Housing Market

Eventually equilibrium will be reestablished, with quantity of houses demanded just equal to the quantity of houses supplied.

---

# What About Excess *Supply*????

In an auction, there's **excess supply** if the initial asking price is too high. Nobody will bid and the auctioneer will have to try a lower price.

---

background-image: url('figures/excess_supply_coats.jpg')
background-size: 800px

---

# Equilibrium

Once the market reaches equilibrium, all buyers and sellers are satisfied, and there's no longer any pressure on price... until something else happens that shifts the curves!

--

**Law of supply and demand**: the price of any good adjusts to make quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded.

---

# Prices

Market-determined prices reflect both what consumers are willing to pay and how expensive the good is to produce.

--

The prices contain *all relevant information* to efficiently allocate the scarce resource. For instance, if a giant copper mine shut down in Zambia, shifting the supply of copper in, the price of copper will rise by *just enough*. 

--
It will discourage people from using copper where there are available substitutes, and the only people that will continue to use copper are the people who find it necessary: copper's most important uses. The increase in price will also incentivize other copper mines to start producing more.

---

# Prices

**Prices** adjusting is the only mechanism in the market that is needed in order to coordinate the behavior of billions of people. Prices are so important, this is why microeconomic theory is sometimes just called *price theory*.

---

&lt;!-- classwork 7.2: how excess supply and excess demand are resolved through prices --&gt;

&lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5jub5jw5uyGFrhiWP9iNPZUAw1nwQ4IT7xdR5XS4TAhe6kQ/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="2435" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"&gt;Loading…&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# But does the supply and demand model work in practice?

--

&lt;span class='pink large'&gt;Yes!&lt;/span&gt;

--
When there are gains from trade to be had, people will find them.

--

Vernon Smith, nobel prize winner and founder of experimental economics, wanted to disprove supply and demand in lab experiments, where economic theory sometimes goes haywire. But what he found was, time and time again, *supply and demand worked*.

---

# Vernon Smith's Experiments

Buyers got cards with the maximum they'd be willing to pay for an imaginary item. For example, it would say "Your Value: $8", or "Your Value: $2."

--

Sellers got similar cards saying things like: "Your Cost: $6", or "Your Cost: $9".

--

Trading began. Buyers and sellers could talk. If they agreed on a price, Vernon Smith shouted the price and paid the buyer and the seller their surplus (difference between the price and the values on their cards) and they left the market.

---

# Vernon Smith's Experiments

After awhile, the price converges to what theory said would be the equilibrium price!

--

Most sellers who had high costs were unable to make sales, and most buyers who had low values were unable to make a purchase.

# Remember the Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy?

15% of the public said **top executives are paid too much** was one of the most important issues for the economy.

--

45% of you agreed. (Maybe a Bernie effect?)

--

But only 5% of economists agreed.

---

# Remember the Survey of Americans and Economists on the Economy?

6% of the public said **business profits are too high** is one of the most important economic issues.

--

12% of you agreed.

--

Only 1% of economists agreed.

# Antimarket Bias

Compared to economists, the public tends to *underestimate the benefits of markets.*

# Antimarket Bias

Economists know **competition** is the only thing that's needed to keep businesses in check. Competition keeps prices low and the quality of goods high.

&lt;span class='footnote'&gt;Bryan Caplan, *The Myth of the Rational Voter*&lt;/span&gt;

--

Without profit maximization, our economic system wouldn't be efficient at all, it would be full of waste.

--

&lt;span class='lightblue small'&gt;"Harnessing the 'base' motive of material self-interest to promote the common good is perhaps *the* most important social invention mankind has yet achieved." - *Charles Shultze, economic advisor to Jimmy Carter*&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Antimarket Bias

Antimarket bias is as old as the market itself. It's deeply rooted in human thinking, and it's frustrated economists for generations.

&lt;span class='footnote'&gt;Bryan Caplan, *The Myth of the Rational Voter*&lt;/span&gt;

--

**Top executives are paid too much and business profits are too high**: are profits gifts to the rich? 

--
No, profits are a quid pro quo. They're incentives for firms to develop new technology and to make things that are useful for people. On top of that, profits incentivize firms to make those things at the lowest possible costs to society in terms of scarce resources.

---

# Antimarket Bias

Most markets are also a lot more competitive than people realize. You may prefer to get a new iPhone, but in a pinch, there are plenty of substitutes (an older iPhone or any other kind of cell phone). So when the price of a good rises, it's usually because of the forces of supply and demand. 

--

Economists are not debating whether or not prices give the right incentives (of course they do). Economists are not debating whether or not a vast business conspiracy runs the world (of course it doesn't). Economists debate about the small details, but *not* about whether the market is good for people or the economy (of course it is).

---

# Review

Prices adjust to bring markets into equilibrium, where quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded.

--

That's the way prices coordinate behavior across billions of people and all the markets they trade in.

--

The model of supply and demand is a simple tool that's really powerful in explaining how markets work.

* Due Thursday before class:
 + Respond to at least one other person for the homework
 + Extra credit: respond to everyone else who made an on time submission
* Due Friday by 6pm:
 + Quiz 4 (available now)
 + Classwork 7.1-7.3 from today
 + Classwork 8 (released Thursday)

# Looking ahead

The midterm exam will be 2 weeks from today. It will be multiple choice, taken during class time, open note, and must be taken alone.

--

There will be no make-up exams (see the syllabus), so it's really important you're in attendance. You'll get 2 attempts, just in case your browser crashes, but you should jot down answers on paper as you go to save time if that happens. Things to study: Classworks, slides, homeworks, and quizzes.

---

# General advice for studying

* Try to understand the concepts deeply instead of memorizing them
* Come to office hours to discuss questions you have
* The test questions will look very similar to what you've been doing (some of them may be a half step harder though), but if you're unprepared, you won't be able to solve them quickly enough to finish during the 90 minutes. You should be very proficient at solving all the problems on the quizzes and classworks.
