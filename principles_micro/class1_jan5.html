&lt;!-- Open Syllabus from Canvas --&gt;

&lt;!-- Make sure to emphasize grading system, no late work, various assignments, discussion sections, email your GE first --&gt;

&lt;!--This class is 4 credits. My expectation is that you're spending 12 hours each week working on it:

+ 3 hours in class (Tuesdays and Thursdays, 1.5 hours each)
+ 1 hour in discussion section (Fridays, cancelled week 1)
+ 1 hour doing the weekly quiz (due Thursday before class)
+ 3 hours doing the weekly reading (due Tuesday before class)
+ 3 hours doing the write portion of weekly homework (due Tuesday before class)
+ 1 hour doing the respond portion of the weekly homework (due Thursday before class)
+ If you have extra time, do the extra credit: respond to everyone in your group (who has done the assignment)!

If you attend class in person, you'll be able to participate in the breakout sessions. Remember to be considerate to your partner. That means be respectful, be friendly, but also don't hit on your partners. Everyone's here to learn, if your partner doesn't "get it" and you do, be empathetic and try your best to explain it. If you both "get it", terrific! Virtual high fives. New friend? Parter for extra credit? 

Direct people to open the slides from Canvas to help with doing classwork.

# Problem

Let's imagine you walk into class the first day. It's a class of 150 students, but there are only 50 seats! 

--

It's up to you to decide who gets the chairs.

---

&lt;!--Classwork 1: brainstorming. 
How should we figure out who gets to sit? Discuss with your partner and come up with 3 potential solutions. Graded for completion, but "i dunno" not accepted: I'll glance over it. Also everyone should submit an answer, it's fine if your group doesn't come to a consensus. --&gt;

&lt;!--breakout rooms: along the bottom or if you're sharing screen, under more. Automatic, 50 rooms. After that, recreate. Closing rooms gives participants a 1min timer to rejoin. I have 117 people enrolled, if there's more than 100 people, do 50 breakout rooms. If less, floor(n/2)--&gt;


&lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmXpUH_M0iP9BQ7OayEkJekf0XIiLZDkxp-DpdZXQHRg4dGQ/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="908" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"&gt;Loading…&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;!-- just read over these quickly before going on --&gt;

---

# Possible solutions

* &lt;span class='yellow'&gt;Equitable solutions:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='yellowunderline'&gt;everyone gets the same&lt;/span&gt;
  + Every student gets to sit for 30 minutes
  + Every student gets a lottery ticket, with a 1/3 chance of getting a seat
  + First come, first serve

--
* Seniority

--
* Merit (people with highest grades?)

--
* &lt;span class='pink'&gt;Efficient solutions:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='pinkunderline'&gt;the people who want the seat most get it&lt;/span&gt;
  + Seats are auctioned and awarded to the highest bidders.

&lt;!-- 'Want the most' is determined by willingness to pay. (what do we do with the revenue? that's besides the point.) --&gt;


---

These are all &lt;span class='green'&gt;**economic systems**&lt;/span&gt; because they determine how to allocate a scarce resource.

&lt;!-- we don't need to spend time on about how we might allocate air for breathing, because it's not scarce. --&gt;

---

# &lt;span class='pink'&gt;Efficiency&lt;/span&gt; through Market-determined Prices

The U.S. economy allocates all the stuff between all the people. 

--
We use market-determined prices to achieve &lt;span class='pink'&gt;efficiency.&lt;/span&gt; The price of the item holds all the information needed to allocate the good efficiently. The market is basically a daily take-it-or-leave-it auction. What does that mean?

---

# Market as a Take-it-or-leave-it Auction

* Willing to buy a haircut? You'll get one.

&lt;!-- If you wake up one day and are willing to pay the market price for a haircut, you'll get a haircut. --&gt;

--

* Willing to pay someone's wage? You can hire them.

&lt;!-- If a business owner wakes up one day and finds they are willing to pay the market price for a worker (wage), they hire the people. --&gt;

--

If 20% of America wakes up in Fall this year after being vaccinated and decides they want to have a wedding, the price of wedding venues may start to increase. The more people there are trying to get something, the more the price is 'bid up'.

---

# Sometimes we try to make the system more &lt;span class='yellow'&gt;equitable&lt;/span&gt;

* Social programs like food stamps and housing assistance

--
* K-12 public school gives education to everyone equally

--
* Everyone can use sidewalks, roads, libraries, and parks for free

---

# But there's an &lt;span class='yellow'&gt;equitability/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='pink'&gt;efficiency&lt;/span&gt; tradeoff

A more &lt;span class='yellow'&gt;equitable&lt;/span&gt; haircut-allocating-system might give every person in the country one free haircut every 4 months. 

--
But what if you want more haircuts? Or what if you don't want so many haircuts? 

--

We could let people sell their haircut tickets to people interested in buying them. That would be a way to get a little more &lt;span class='pink'&gt;efficiency&lt;/span&gt; in the equitable system by letting the market play a role.

---
# &lt;span class='yellow'&gt;Equitability/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='pink'&gt;efficiency&lt;/span&gt; tradeoff

Likewise, your parents can send you to a private school if they don't like the public one (provided they're willing to pay). 

--

You can go to the bookstore if you can't find what you're looking for in the library.

---

# Market Prices

The most efficient system for allocating the seats in the class is the auction system. It puts a price on the chair, and that price is determined by the fixed supply and your demand.

--
Let's try it!

---

&lt;!-- Classwork 2: What's the maximum amount you'd pay for a seat? Venmo is allowed, the cash doesn't have to be in your pocket. --&gt;

&lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeeoOhG1C3y_YZ1e7CCRwL5QspGOoKj3gawawaOE9kO3yBfJg/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="626" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"&gt;Loading…&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Market Prices

So if there's 50 chairs, what's the price that would clear the market? 

--
That is, at what price would there be just 50 people wanting to sit?

&lt;!-- 
Solve the problem with their data!
click on green google sheets icon,
right click on column and sort sheet Z-A,
price on the 50th index will clear the market.
Copy paste it into a new spreadsheet, get public viewable link, add it to the google form for next classroom exercise.
--&gt;

---

&lt;!-- Classwork 1.3: Market Clearing Price --&gt;

&lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5PpNVeedj8lyiZ__iHCOQKbbewI862SCLrFo6a4h91Gbdeg/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="825" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"&gt;Loading…&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Market Prices

When there's 100 seats, the market clearing price is 1 cent.

--

When there's 50 seats, the market clearing price is $1.05.

--

When there's 10 seats, the market clearing price is $2.40.

--

**Holding demand constant, the more scarce a good is, the higher the price.** This is what we'd expect in an auction.

---

&lt;span class='large darkblue'&gt;What if instead, we hold supply constant and change demand?&lt;/span&gt;

Suppose there's a fixed supply of 20 seats. Data [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xNz9f8oUN38AZ_mD73IV5-J079eHySMQQ8X06eKpj8k/edit?usp=sharing)

&lt;!-- random sampling of students --&gt;

--

With demand of 109 students, the market clearing price is $2.10.

With demand of 50 students, the market clearing price is $1.20.

With demand of 25 students, the market clearing price is $0.03.

--

**Holding supply constant, the less people there are bidding, the lower the price.** This is also what we'd expect in an auction.

---

# Scarcity

**Scarcity** - when there's not enough of something to go around, or not enough to satisfy our wants.

--

* Natural resources (minerals, clean water, clean air, etc)

--

* Labor

--

* Time in the day, the year, your life!

---

**Free resources** are opposite of scarce. Your consumption of it doesn't measurably take away from the amount available for other people.

--
* Air in general
* Sunshine
* A video on Youtube

--

Whether a resource is free or not also depends on the environment. On Earth, air is free. But on the moon, it's important to economize the air you bring with you!

---

# What's the best system for allocating COVID-19 vaccines?

How do we define "best"?

--

* Fast and efficient. The people who need them the most (at the highest risk, etc) should get them first.

&lt;!-- right now, people with connections get the vaccine. or, they have a list and are letting vaccines expire if the person doesn't show up. or vaccinating anyone randomly if the person doesn't show up. --&gt;

&lt;!-- auctioning off doses would go at least halfway toward accomplishing this, if people are OK at assessing their own risk! and it would generate revenue. --&gt;

--

* But also equitable. They certainly shouldn't be so expensive that people can't afford them.

&lt;!--  the UK is vaccinating elderly before hospital workers. If you're trying to save the most lives, maybe this is the way to go. --&gt;

---


# Scarcity

**Scarcity** - when there's not enough of something to go around, or not enough to satisfy our wants.

When a resource is scarce, we have to make **trade-offs.** 

Example: because your time is scarce, you have to make tradeoffs with how to spend it.

&lt;!-- You only have 24 hours in your day, so by choosing to spend time doing one thing, that means you can't do another thing. When you choose to play video games for eight hours, that means you can't be studying for those eight hours. --&gt;

---

# Example: Scarce Resources on a Farm

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/04/14/farm_day_1920x1080_wide-d49994dd6440a8dd9a0f2d5a9e826ffdfdb47959.png" width="300px" /&gt;
]

--
.pull-right[
* Time in the day
* Money
* Energy
* Land
]

&lt;!-- If you spend too many hours fishing, then you can't water all your crops. --&gt;

&lt;!-- If you spend too much money on seeds, then you can't spend it on a chicken coop.--&gt;

&lt;!-- If you spend all your energy chopping down trees, then you're too exhausted to go fishing. --&gt;

&lt;!-- If you have a big garden, that takes away land available for grass for your animals. --&gt;

---

# Opportunity Cost

&lt;!-- Opportunity cost is the fundamental way that economists think about costs. --&gt;

The opportunity cost of something is your valuation of your next best alternative: it's the best thing you had to give up. **The opportunity cost is the opportunity lost.**

--

When non-economists talk about costs, they're usually referring to *accounting costs*- the sticker price of something. Or, how much you had to pay to get it.

---

# Example

On the farm, what's the cost of spending all day fishing?

--

* Accounting cost: $0. &lt;!--  You don't have to pay for anything to go fishing. --&gt;

--
* Opportunity cost: If you had to skip watering your crops in order to go fishing, then the opportunity cost of fishing all day includes the crops that dried up and died while you were gone.

--

Economics is the study of **choice.** Opportunity cost is a much more useful tool for understanding choice than accounting cost.

---

# Example

Suppose you have a farm and you're planting a garden. You have $8 to spend on seeds. Parsnip seeds cost $4 each and will grow one parsnip. You can sell each parsnip for $6.

--

What's the accounting cost of planting parsnips?

--
$8 &lt;!--You'll buy 2 parsnips and spend all your money.--&gt;

--

What's the revenue from planting parsnips?

--
$12 &lt;!-- 6*2--&gt;

--

What will your profit be for planting parsnips?

--
$4

--

Is planting parsnips a good decision?

--
Yes. &lt;!-- you'll earn a positive profit --&gt;

---

# Example

You go to the store to buy the parsnip seeds, and you see they're also selling cauliflower seeds. They cost $8 each and you can sell a cauliflower for $16. By spending your money on parsnip seeds, you can't spend your money on cauliflower seeds.

--

What's the opportunity cost of choosing parsnip seeds?

--
$8 &lt;!-- By choosing parsnip seeds, you can't earn the cauliflower profits, so you miss out on 16-8=$8.--&gt;

--

**Economic profit** is accounting profit minus opportunity cost. What's the economic profit of choosing parsnip seeds?

--
-$4 &lt;!-- Parsnip profit: $4 minus opportunity cost: $8. -4--&gt;

--

Is planting parsnips a good decision?

--
No. &lt;!-- Not when cauliflower seeds are an option! The best use of resources is the choice with nonnegative economic profit. --&gt;

---

&lt;!-- Classwork 1.4: Opportunity Cost https://forms.gle/vCptTyeMphFFWQi19 --&gt;

&lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbaK8ky0npeL0soUVE9sVTdaac8L8ODaQTKtrHuB1jT_AAwA/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="2343" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"&gt;Loading…&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

Most of the time though, our objectives are more complicated than just to maximize monetary profit.

--

Suppose I'm trying to collect enough wood to build a barn.

--

.pull-left[
&lt;span class='green'&gt;Option 1: Chop wood all day&lt;/span&gt;
]

--

.pull-right[
&lt;span class='orange'&gt;Option 2: 
Fish all day, sell the fish, and then buy the wood&lt;/span&gt;
]

--

The best option depends on how much wood you can get by chopping, how much fish you can get by fishing, the price of the fish, and the price of wood.

---

But what if I just *enjoy* fishing more than I enjoy chopping wood? Even if it's the best option to chop wood, I could still decide to fish just because I like it more.

--

Economists try to measure how much people like things in dollar values.

--

For instance, suppose you know you'll be $100 short if you take option 2 and fish all day, so to get the barn, you'll have to pay $100 out of your savings. If you decide to fish anyway, then you probably like to fish at least $100 more than you like to chop wood.

---

# Review: Opportunity Cost

* The opportunity cost is the opportunity lost by making a choice.

--
* If the economic profit of a choice is greater than zero, then it's your best option.

--
* People make choices to fulfill certain objectives. Those sometimes include maximizing monetary profits, maximizing enjoyment, or something else entirely like collecting enough wood to build a barn, or earning a passing grade in a class.

---

# Review: Scarcity

* Economic systems determine how to allocate scarce resources.

--
* Market-determined prices make economic systems more efficient by giving goods to the people that are willing to pay, similar to an auction.

--
* We want our economic systems to be equitable along with efficient. That requires some government intervention (wealth transfers and building schools)

--
* In the classroom seats example where there are 50 chairs, the market clearing price is the one that makes just 50 people willing to pay to sit.
