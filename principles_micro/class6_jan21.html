# Last class

We talked about the **principle of increasing marginal cost**. When you start to produce a whole lot of something, you start to get decreasing marginal returns and you have to start using factors of production that are better suited for other purposes.

--

We also saw an example of a **production possibilities frontier** and we learned that (with 2 caveats) **marginal cost is the same as supply**.

---

**Q: Does the equation to find marginal cost change if you add in more options? For example; I could grow grapes, corn, or carrots on my land.**

&lt;span class='small'&gt;A: Sort of! Your optimal *ratio* between corn and grapes would stay the same, because that's just determined by the trade-offs you have to make between corn and grapes (the marginal cost) and the market prices of corn and grapes (the marginal benefit).&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small'&gt;When you add a third option, geometrically the PPF becomes a &lt;span class='yellowunderline'&gt;surface&lt;/span&gt; instead of a line and the optimal *level* of corn and grapes may change depending on the trade-offs you have to make with carrots.&lt;/span&gt;

---

---

**Q: Is the principle of increasing marginal cost applicable to everything?**

A: Yes! When you consider the production of any scarce good, eventually marginal costs will skyrocket.

--

Say you have a paperclip factory and you make 10 paperclips a day. At first, paperclips are very cheap to make. So you start to expand: now you're making hundreds of paperclips every day. You build a small factory on cheap land in the middle of nowhere where rent is cheap. You hire the people who will work for minimum wage. You get metal from the recycling at almost zero cost.

---

So you expand some more, and now you're making millions of paperclips every day. 

--

You need more materials, so you start buying metal for cars, and that's a lot more expensive.

--

You need more factory workers, so you raise the wage to attract more people.

--

Maybe you even hire a team of engineers from MIT to build you better paperclip making machines. 

--

You build factories in every major city in the world (and rent is not cheap in cities)!

---

As your paperclip business takes over the world, the factors of production you use have *increasing opportunity costs*. The team of MIT engineers you hire could have otherwise been solving really important problems, so you have to pay them quite a lot.

--

Rent is high in cities because of the *opportunity cost* of the land. If you weren't using it for your paperclip factory, it could have been used for a grocery store, some condos, or even a big park that hundreds of people could enjoy every day.

---

As a small paperclip factory, you were only using the factors of production that were the **cheapest**, so your marginal cost was low.

--

As you expand, you exhaust those sources. You start using factors of production that have higher and higher opportunity costs. 

--

So if you keep expanding, your marginal cost keeps increasing. Eventually, every productive resource in the entire world is being used for your paperclip factory, and nothing else is produced. 

--

That means there are no cars or consumer products, food, education, healthcare, government, or anything! That's quite a [high opportunity cost](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/)!

# Sunk costs

Another important concept for understanding decision-making by producers is **sunk costs** - costs that were already incurred, so a rational decisionmaker shouldn't let them influence decisions about what to do in the future.

--

Suppose the maximum you're willing to pay to go see a movie is $20. The ticket only costs $15, so you buy it. But the ticket falls out of your pocket before you can enter the theater, and you can't find it anywhere. Should you buy another ticket?

---

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;If you still value the movie at $20, then you should! The $15 from the lost ticket is **sunk**. There's no way for you to get that money back, so if you're still optimizing, you stop crying over spilt milk and you consider (again) the fact that you value the movie at $20 and you only have to pay $15 for another ticket.&lt;/span&gt;

--

.pull-left[
Option 1: going home

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;
* &lt;span class='orange'&gt;$15 ticket (lost)&lt;/span&gt;
* Surplus: -$15
&lt;/span&gt;
]

--

.pull-left[
Option 2: buy another

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;
* &lt;span class='orange'&gt;$15 ticket (lost)
* &lt;span class='orange'&gt;$15 for another ticket&lt;/span&gt;
* &lt;span class='green'&gt;$20 in enjoyment for seeing the movie&lt;/span&gt;
* Surplus: -$15 - $15 + $20 = $-10&lt;/span&gt;
]

---

# Sunk costs

Another example: you expect to make $20,000 of revenue on a business venture, and you expect the costs to be $15,000. So you get to work on the venture. 

--

But halfway through, when you've already spent $10,000, you learn that the the costs will likely be $25,000 in total instead of $15,000. Should you continue working on the project?

---

# Sunk costs

Yes, you should. The $10,000 you've already spent is **sunk**. Optimizing into the future, you know you have to spend $15,000 more on top of what you've already spent, but you'll still make $20,000.

--

If you give up, your loss is the $10,000 you've spent. If you continue on, you lose $25,000, gain $20,000, so your net loss is $5,000. But like in the lost ticket example, if you had known from the beginning that you were going to make a mistake by underestimating the costs, you wouldn't have even started the venture.

---

# Sunk Costs

Sunk costs also explain why you can sometimes find great deals on flights or hotels.

--

If a plane is about to take off with 5 empty seats, the airline should accept any amount in order to fill those seats, because any amount would be better than leaving the seats empty and getting nothing.

--

The same is true for hotel rooms. If a hotel isn't full for the night, they may as well give out large discounts because the only extra cost that filling a room will bring is the cost of cleaning and laundry for one more guest.

---

&lt;!-- classwork 6.1: business venture, you expect to get $1M in revenue, you expect costs will be $800k. After you spend $400k, you learn that costs will actually be $1.2M. Should you continue? Yes, because you only have to spend $800k more and you will earn $1M. What if you learn costs will actually be $1.5M? No, because you have to spend $1.1M more and will only earn $1M. --&gt;

**Q: Does a change in the number of consumers in the market change the demand curve?** Does a change in the number of producers in the market change the supply curve?

--

Yes! The market demand curve will be the *sum* of the demand curves of the consumers. 

--

And the market supply curve will be the sum of the supply curves of all the producers! Let's see an example.

# Price Elasticity of Supply: the shape of the supply curve

**price elasticity of supply** - a measure of how much the quantity supplied of a good responds to a change in the price of that good.

--

&lt;span class='pink'&gt;price elasticity of supply = % change in quantity supplied / % change in price&lt;/span&gt;

--

What does elastic versus inelastic supply look like?

---

background-image: url('figures/price_elasticity_supply.jpg')
background-size: 800px

---

# Elastic or Inelastic?

Supply is more likely to be **elastic** if producers can easily store the good or easily change the level of production.

--

Supply also tends to be more elastic in the long run. That's because over the long run, producers enter or exit the market, or make other big decisions like building new factories or closing down and selling old ones.

---

# Elastic or Inelastic?

Example: in the short run, supply of oil is fairly **inelastic** because oil is expensive to store and it's expensive to start to extract oil in new areas. But in the long run, companies can respond to changes in price.

---

# Supply Determinants

When a factor that's not named on either axis changes, the supply curve may **shift**.

--

These factors might have to do with:

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;
* Price of inputs
* Price of other goods that a supplier could easily pivot to (think about the corn or grapes example)
* Technology used in production
* Producers' expectations about the future price of the good they're selling
* The number of producers
&lt;/span&gt;

# Supply Determinants

What happens to the supply of vanilla ice cream when...

--

The price of sugar falls?

--
&lt;span class='lightblue'&gt;The supply of vanilla ice cream shifts out.&lt;/span&gt;

--

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="figures/supply_shift_out.jpg" width="350px" height="250px" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;Since sugar is an *input* into ice cream, when the price of sugar falls, the **marginal cost** of producing any unit of ice cream would fall (shift right). So at any given price, producers would be willing to produce more ice cream.&lt;/span&gt;
]

---

# Supply Determinants

What happens to the supply of vanilla ice cream when...

--

The price of chocolate ice cream rises?

--
&lt;span class='lightblue'&gt;The supply of vanilla ice cream shifts in.&lt;/span&gt;

--

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="figures/supply_shift_in.jpg" width="350px" height="250px" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;Vanilla ice cream producers will pivot to chocolate ice cream. So at any given price of vanilla ice cream, producers are willing to supply less (shift left).&lt;/span&gt;]

---

&lt;img src="figures/supply_shift_in.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" /&gt;

You can think about the **opportunity cost** as a factor in the marginal cost of vanilla ice cream. The fact that chocolate ice cream is now more profitable increases the marginal cost of each unit of vanilla ice cream.

---

# Supply Determinants

What happens to the supply of vanilla ice cream when...

--

The minimum wage is raised and vanilla ice cream producers have to start paying their factory workers more?

--
&lt;span class='lightblue'&gt;The supply of vanilla ice cream shifts in (labor is an input, like sugar).&lt;/span&gt;

--

A new machine is invented that automates every step of the production process, eliminating the need for factory workers altogether?

--
&lt;span class='lightblue'&gt;The supply of vanilla ice cream shifts out (reduces the marginal cost of each unit).&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Supply Determinants

What happens to the supply of vanilla ice cream when...

--

A new law makes it legal for people to start selling ice cream out of their own homes to restaurants and grocery stores? (As a result, there are many more producers in the market.)

--
&lt;span class='lightblue'&gt;The supply of vanilla ice cream shifts out.&lt;/span&gt;

--

Producers all start expecting that the price of vanilla ice cream will increase in the future?

--
&lt;span class='lightblue'&gt;The supply of vanilla ice cream shifts in today (producers start storing ice cream instead of selling it in anticipation).&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Supply Determinants

What happens to the supply of vanilla ice cream when...

--

The price of vanilla ice cream rises? (beware: this is a trick question!)

--
&lt;span class='lightblue'&gt;The quantity supplied of vanilla ice cream will increase, but the supply curve will stay in the same place.&lt;/span&gt;

--

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="figures/move_along_supply.jpg" width="350px" height="250px" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;Up until now, I've been asking you what happens to supply if a factor changes that's not listed on one of the axis. But the supply curve *itself* tells us what happens if price changes: quantity supplied changes in the same direction.&lt;/span&gt;]

# Review: Sunk Costs

Sunk costs don't matter to an optimizing decisionmaker who is looking into the future. 

--

That's why hotels and airlines put empty rooms and seats on big discounts.

--

That's also why producers weigh **marginal** costs against marginal benefits when making supply decisions, instead of the *total* costs. If a hotel owner is always thinking about how much money it took to build their hotel in the first place, they'll likely miss opportunities to maximize their profit with those discounts for empty rooms.

---

# Review: Multiple Consumers, Multiple Producers

Individual marginal benefit and marginal cost curves can be added **horizontally** to determine market demand or supply curves

--

At high prices, only the consumers that are willing to pay the most buy units.

--

At low prices, only the producers that can produce with the lowest marginal costs supply units to the market.

---

# Review: Price Elasticity of Supply

&lt;span class='pink'&gt;price elasticity of supply = % change in quantity supplied / % change in price&lt;/span&gt;

--

When the price elasticity of supply is less than 1, we say supply is **inelastic**. The curve will look steep. The quantity supplied doesn't react much to changes in price.

--

When the price elasticity of supply is greater than 1, we say supply is **elastic**. The curve will look flat. The quantity supplied reacts a lot to changes in price.
