# Free Markets

We learned that free markets, where the government doesn't impose any taxes or price controls, maximizes the gains from trade (total surplus) to consumers and producers.

--

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;Caveat #1: In the presence of &lt;span class='pink'&gt;externalities,&lt;/span&gt; a solution like a corrective tax which internalizes the externality may increase total surplus to society in general. In some cases, the Coase Theorem tells us that private bargaining can reach the efficient outcome as long as transaction costs are low and there aren't too many interested parties involved.&lt;/span&gt;

# Free Markets

We learned that free markets, where the government doesn't impose any taxes or price controls, maximizes the gains from trade (total surplus) to consumers and producers.

Caveat #1: &lt;span class='pink'&gt;Externalities&lt;/span&gt;

Caveat #2: &lt;span class='pink'&gt;Public goods &amp; Common Resources&lt;/span&gt;

Caveat #3: &lt;span class='pink'&gt;Market power&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Public Goods

*"The best things in life are free."*

--

* Stuff nature provides: rivers, mountains, beaches, lakes, and oceans

--

* Stuff government provides: parks, libraries, playgrounds, parades, fireworks

---

# Fireworks Example

Many people enjoy the benefits of fireworks when one person pays for them. Great, right?

--

The downside: if many people enjoy the benefits but only one party pays, that's a big positive externality. Prices are therefore ineffective at maximizing total surplus.

---

# Fireworks Example

Suppose there's a small town that doesn't currently have a fireworks display on the 4th of July, and you want to put one on. Everyone you talk to is in favor of it. You think people would get about $10 of benefit from it.

--

There's 500 people in the town, so you estimate that the total benefit of a fireworks display to the town is about $5,000. The cost of a fireworks display is only $1,000, so it clearly seems like a good use of resources.

---

# Fireworks Example

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;The problem is that when you start fundraising for the show, you can only raise $500. All the people who seemed so eager before about the idea are now much less so. What's going on?&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;The people of the small town know that whether or not they pay for the show, they'll be able to enjoy it just by looking up. So if at all possible, they'd prefer it if someone else paid and they got to enjoy the benefits. Goods like fireworks displays have a **free rider problem**: people are able to receive the benefit of the good but avoid paying for it.&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;So you have to cancel the fireworks show because you can't raise enough money, but not because people don't want the show! The show is socially desirable, but the market can't provide it because of the free rider problem.&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Fireworks Example

What's the solution? 

--

The local government can hire you to put on the fireworks show and tax everyone an extra $2 to pay for it. Everyone in the town is better off by $8 (their benefit of $10 minus the $2 tax bill). The fireworks were impossible to provide people through the market, but made possible through government intervention.

--

But without market determined prices, it's up to the government to do their best at a cost-benefit analysis. Should they put on a fireworks show once a year, or once a month? Should they put 20 parks in a city, or is 19 alright?

---

# Different kinds of goods

What in particular makes a good susceptible to the free rider problem? What are some important properties goods can have?

--

At the beginning of the course, we learned that some goods are **scarce** and some goods are **free**. When a good is scarce, there's not enough to satisfy our wants, so trade-offs have to be made. Time in your day is scarce, so you have to make decisions about how you want to spend that time.

--

Free resources are plentiful enough to satisfy all wants, so no trade-offs have to be made concerning those resources. While clean air on Earth is increasingly scarce, air in general is free.

---

# Rivalrous Goods

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;A related but slightly different concept is that goods can be *rivalrous or non-rivalrous*.&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;A good is **rivalrous** if one person's use diminishes another person's ability to use the good. When I eat a hot dog, you can't, so a hot dog is rivalrous. And when a factory pollutes the air, people no longer have clean air to breathe, so clean air is rivalrous.&lt;/span&gt;

--

&lt;span class='small squeeze'&gt;But when I have a picnic in the park, you can do the same thing, and neither of us are having a worse time. Since two people can use the park at the same time without diminishing the other's utility, public parks are nonrivalrous. But if everyone in the city had a picnic in the park at the same time, the congestion would start to diminish everyone's utility. So while public parks are nonrivalrous, *busy* public parks are rivalrous.&lt;/span&gt;

---

# Rivalrous Goods vs Scarce Goods

**Rivalrous and scarce:** hot dogs, clean air

--

**Non-rivalrous and not scarce:** air in general

--

**Non-rivalrous and scarce:** public parks and fireworks

--

**Rivalrous and not scarce:** some sand on the beach

---

# Excludability

Another property goods can have is that goods can either be *excludable or non-excludable*.

--
A good is **excludable** if access to it can be controlled by making people pay for it.

--
For example, hot dogs are excludable because a hot dog vendor can prevent you from enjoying the hot dog, asking that you pay for it first.

--

But fireworks are non-excludable because when someone has a fireworks show, it goes so far up into the sky that people can enjoy it from miles around. Nobody can exclude another person from enjoying a fireworks show if that person doesn't pay.

# Common Goods/Resources

Common goods are non-excludable like public goods, but the difference is that they're rivalrous.

--

Take the example of the English "Commons" of the 17th century. The Commons were common grazing land in every village that could freely be used by any villager to graze and feed their cattle or sheep.

--

The Commons were non-excludable because they were free for anyone to use, but they were rivalrous because the more they were used, the less the grass could replenish itself.

---

# Tragedy of the Commons

If every villager kept their flocks small, the Commons could be used sustainably.

--

And if just one villager grew a larger flock, the social costs would be small. That villager would make more money, privately enjoying the benefits of a larger flock. The problem is that villager doesn't carry the full cost of the larger flock; he shares it by depleting the Commons by a little bit.

---

# Tragedy of the Commons

But if every villager responds to these incentives, they'll all have too large a flock than what would be socially optimal. The Commons would be destroyed by overexploitation, and no one would be able to raise cattle or sheep. This is what's called **the tragedy of the commons**.

---

# Tragedy of the Commons

Suppose there are 2 herdsmen that share a plot of grass for grazing. One uses it during the morning and the other uses it in the afternoon. If they both keep their flocks small, they can sustainably earn $200 per day each.

--

But if they both increase the size of their flocks, they will destroy the grass and will only make $90 per day each.

--

If one herdsman has a large flock and the other has a small one, some grass is still able to re-grow and the herdsman with the large flock makes $500 per day, and the herdsman with the small flock makes $80 per day.

---

# Tragedy of the Commons

When there's a common resource, people have an *incentive* to overuse it because they capture the benefits privately but share the costs.

--

Another way to think about the use of a common resource is that it creates a small **negative externality** on everyone else every time you graze your sheep on the Commons. A solution to the tragedy of the commons is to *internalize* the externality by dividing up the land between villagers. If you own the land you graze your sheep on, you have every incentive to keep it in good condition and not overuse it.

---

# Tragedy of the Commons

Other solutions:

* Government can regulate the usage of the resource by setting limits on the number of sheep anyone can own, or limits on the number of sheep you can graze at any time

--

* Government can impose a corrective tax by taxing the ownership of sheep

---

# Examples of Common Resources

* Clean air and water are common resources. Polluting is regulated and taxed, but there's still probably too much pollution.

--

* Fish in the ocean are a common resource. Overfishing is still a big problem, but there are laws and regulations that try to help. Encouraging fishermen to throw small fish back is one.

---

# Recap

Both public goods and common resources suffer from inefficient allocations in market settings, and government interventions can potentially raise total surplus in those situations.

--

Public goods have positive externalities associated with their use, which results in the problem of free riders.

--

Common resources have negative externalities associated with their use, which results in the tragedy of the commons.
