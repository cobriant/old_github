# Intro to the Tidyverse by Colleen O'Briant

# In order to progress, all you need to do is fill in the blanks: __.
# Then run the code (command + enter on a mac) to make sure you're
# getting the desired result.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: `ggplot()` `geom`s
#   In this chapter, we'll practice using some of the most commonly used 
#   `geom`s, one by one. Keep in mind that you can use multiple `geoms` at 
#   a time by layering them on top of each other.

# Run this code to get started and to view the data:
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
View(gapminder)

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# My favorite `geom`s for looking at the distribution of one variable:
#  `geom_histogram()`,
#  `geom_freqpoly()`,
#  `geom_area()`,
#  `geom_density()`

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. `geom_histogram()`
# 1.1 Draw a histogram using `geom_histogram()`.
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, color = continent, fill = continent)) +
  __

# 1.2 Experiment with different `binwidth`s for your histogram.
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, color = continent, fill = continent)) +
  __(binwidth = __)

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. `geom_freqpoly()`
#   `geom_freqpoly()` is just like a histogram, but it uses lines 
#   instead of bars to communicate the number of observations in each
#   bin. Again, experiment with binwidth.
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  __(binwidth = __)

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. `geom_area()`
#   You can make a filled frequency polygon using an area plot:
#   `geom_area()`. 

# 3.1 In the blank, experiment with setting `color` versus `fill` as 
#   `continent`.

ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, __ = continent)) +
  geom_area(stat = "bin")

# 3.2 Notice that the continents are stacked up on top of each other in
# the previous plot. To change that behavior, set `position = "identity"`
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
  geom_area(stat = "bin", position = __)

# 3.3 The issue now is that there's overplotting. Data for the Americas
# is totally hidden behind the other continents! One way to fix this is
# to adjust the transparency of points through `alpha`. Setting `alpha = .5`
# reduces the `geom` transparency to 50%. Experiment with different alphas.

ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, fill = continent)) +
  geom_area(stat = "bin", position = "identity", alpha = __)

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 4. `geom_density()`: 
#   An alternative to bin visualizations is density visualizations. 
#   They smooth out the distributions and account for factors like the fact 
#   that there aren't very many observations from Oceania. The downside 
#   is what's measured on the y-axis is less intuitive than the `count` 
#   we've seen in the other `geom`s.

# 4.1 Experiment with setting `color` and `fill` to `continent`.
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, __)) +
  __()

# 4.2 Also experiment with different `alpha`s.
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, __)) +
  __(alpha = __)

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Graphical primitives:
# `geom_vline()` adds a vertical line
# `geom_hline()` adds a horizontal line
# `geom_segment()` adds a line segment
# `geom_rect()` adds a rectangle
# `annotate()` adds annotations to your plot

# 6.1 Add a vertical line to this plot.
#     Hint: for a vertical line, you'll need to specify an x-intercept
#     (and for a horizontal line, you'd need to specify a y-intercept).
#     Do this with `xintercept = 70`.
ggplot(data = gapminder, 
       aes(x = lifeExp, color = continent, fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .3) +
  __

# 6.2 Include the vertical line you did above, and also note how the 
# annotation (`annotate()`) labels the line.
Annotate this plot with `annotate()`
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = lifeExp, 
                             color = continent, 
                             fill = continent)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .3) +
  __ +
  annotate("text", x = 70, y = .075, label = "70 years", angle = 90)

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# My favorite `geom`s for plots comparing a variable on the x-axis to a
# variable on the y-axis:
# `geom_point()`
# `geom_smooth()`
# `geom_line()`
# `geom_hex()`
# `geom_boxplot()`
# `geom_violin()`

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 7. `geom_point()`
# We've already talked about basic scatterplots. Try to recall how to draw
# a `ggplot` that plots `gdpPercap` on the x-axis and `lifeExp` on the y-axis.

__

# 8. `geom_smooth()`
# 8.1 Add a smoothed line layer to the plot you did above using 
# `geom_smooth()`.

__

# 8.2 Remove the standard error ribbon using `geom_smooth(se = FALSE)`

__

# 8.3 Visualize the OLS fit by using `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`
# "lm" stands for "linear model".

__

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. The visualization we made in 8) needs some work. The first issue is
# that there seems to be heteroskedasticity, so our fitted line is not a 
# good fit. A quick fix is to apply a log transformation to gdpPercap.

# 9.1 Instead of plotting `gdpPercap` on the x-axis, plot the log of that 
# `gdpPercap` using the `log()` function.
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = __, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# Notice that the units on the x-axis of the previous plot are in log
#   terms, which is hard to interpret. I prefer this method:
#   Do a log transformation of the x-axis using `scale_x_log10()`,
#   and use `labels = scales::comma` to suppress scientific notation on the
#   labels for the x-axis.

ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# 9.2 The second issue is that there's overplotting near the center. I'd like
# a way to visualize how dense the points are getting. For this, we can
# replace `geom_point()` with `geom_hex()`.

ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::comma) +
  __ +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 10. `geom_line()`
# Draw a line plot using `geom_line`. Compare US `gdpPercap` over 
# time to two other countries of your choice.

ggplot(data = filter(gapminder, 
                     country %in% c("United States", __, __)), 
       aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap, color = country)) +
  geom_line()

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 11. Draw a boxplot with `geom_boxplot()` that compares the 
# gdpPercap (on the y-axis) of different continents (on the x-axis, 
# also using color). Experiment with applying a log transformation
# to gdpPercap (now on the y-axis).

ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdoPercap, y = continent, color = continent)) +
  __

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 12. Change the plot from 11) to be a violin plot using `geom_violin`.
# Also include `fill`. Make sure you use `scale_y_log10()` to transform the
# y-axis into log terms.

ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = __, y = __, color = __, fill = __)) +
  scale__ +
  __

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Finally, check out how simple it is to change your `facet_wrap` to 
# a slick animation with `gganimate`!
# The `facet_wrap` version:
ggplot(data = gapminder, 
       aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent)) +
  geom_density2d(color = "grey", alpha = .5) +
  facet_wrap(~ year)
# The animated version (this may take a second to render)
install.packages("gganimate")
library(gganimate)
ggplot(data = gapminder, 
       aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = continent)) +
  geom_density2d(color = "grey", alpha = .5) +
  gganimate::transition_time(year) +
  labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}")
